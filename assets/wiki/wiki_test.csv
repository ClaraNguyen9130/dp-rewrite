Inflation,"With high inflation, purchasing power is redistributed from those on fixed nominal incomes, such as some pensioners whose pensions are not indexed to the price level, towards those with variable incomes whose earnings may better keep pace with the inflation. This redistribution of purchasing power will also occur between international trading partners. Where fixed exchange rates are imposed, higher inflation in one economy than another will cause the first economy's exports to become more expensive and affect the balance of trade."
Air pollution,"Many sources of local air pollution, especially burning fossil fuels, also release greenhouse gases that cause global warming. However air pollution may limit warming locally. Air pollution kills 7 or 8 million people each year."
Air pollution,"is mostly created when NOx and volatile organic compounds mix in the presence of sunlight. It can also form from carbon monoxide or methane. Due to the influence of temperature and sunlight on this reaction, high ozone levels are most common on hot summer afternoons."
Inflation,"The opposite of CPI inflation is deflation, a decrease in the general price level of goods and services. The common measure of inflation is the inflation rate, the annualized percentage change in a general price index. Changes in inflation are widely attributed to fluctuations in real demand for goods and services (also known as demand shocks, including changes in fiscal or monetary policy), changes in available supplies such as during energy crises (also known as supply shocks), or changes in inflation expectations, which may be self-fulfilling."
Inflation,"In economics, inflation is an increase in the average price of goods and services in terms of money. This increase is measured using a price index, typically a consumer price index (CPI). When the general price level rises, each unit of currency buys fewer goods and services; consequently, inflation corresponds to a reduction in the purchasing power of money."
Inflation,"This was contrary to Keynesian thinking which in principle recognized a role for monetary policy, but in practice believed that the effect from interest rate changes to the real economy was slight, making monetary policy an ineffective instrument, preferring fiscal policy. Conversely, monetarists considered fiscal policy, or government spending and taxation, as ineffective in controlling inflation. Friedman also took issue with the traditional Keynesian view concerning the Phillips curve."
Air pollution,"For PM2.5, a 1% increase in pollution levels would lead to around $5 billion in losses, especially in colder climates. After air pollutants enter the agricultural environment, they not only directly affect agricultural production and quality, but also enter agricultural waters and soil. Air pollution further decreases the productivity of labourers via health impacts."
Air pollution,"(called aerosols), or gases. Pollutants are classified as primary or secondary. Primary pollutants are produced directly by a source and remain in the same chemical form after they have been emitted into the atmosphere."
Inflation,"The adoption of fiat currency by many countries, from the 18th century onwards, made much larger variations in the supply of money possible. Rapid increases in the money supply have taken place a number of times in countries experiencing political crises, producing hyperinflations – episodes of extreme inflation rates much higher than those observed in earlier periods of commodity money. The hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic of Germany is a notable example."
