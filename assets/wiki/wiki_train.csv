Air pollution,"Health effects are concentrated among women, who are likely to be responsible for cooking, and young children. Gas stoves for cooking contribute to indoor air pollution by emitting NO2, benzene and carbon monoxide. Toasters can produce particulate pollution."
Inflation,"Those weighted average prices are combined to calculate the overall price. To better relate price changes over time, indexes typically choose a ""base year"" price and assign it a value of 100. Index prices in subsequent years are then expressed in relation to the base year price."
Inflation,"Overall inflation is measured as the price change of a large ""basket"" of representative goods and services. This is the purpose of a price index, which is the combined price of a ""basket"" of many goods and services. The combined price is the sum of the weighted prices of items in the ""basket""."
Inflation,"Moderate inflation affects economies in both positive and negative ways. The negative effects would include an increase in the opportunity cost of holding money; uncertainty over future inflation, which may discourage investment and savings; and, if inflation were rapid enough, shortages of goods as consumers begin hoarding out of concern that prices will increase in the future. Positive effects include reducing unemployment due to nominal wage rigidity, allowing the central bank greater freedom in carrying out monetary policy, encouraging loans and investment instead of money hoarding, and avoiding the inefficiencies associated with deflation."
Inflation,"(""incomes policies""). Temporary price controls may be used as a complement to other policies to fight inflation; price controls may make disinflation faster, while reducing the need for unemployment to reduce inflation. If price controls are used during a recession, the kinds of distortions that price controls cause may be lessened."
Air pollution,"HCl comes from coal combustion. H2SO4 forms from SO2, which comes from the burning of coal and oil and from some industrial processes like smelting. HNO3 forms from NO2, which is formed during high-temperature combustion."
Inflation,"An alternative theory, the real bills doctrine (RBD), originated in the 17th and 18th century, receiving its first authoritative exposition in Adam Smith's The Wealth of Nations. It asserts that banks should issue their money in exchange for short-term real bills of adequate value. As long as banks only issue a dollar in exchange for assets worth at least a dollar, the issuing bank's assets will naturally move in step with its issuance of money, and the money will hold its value."
Air pollution,"In South and East Asia, pregnant women are frequently exposed to indoor air pollution because of wood and other biomass fuels being used for cooking, which are responsible for more than 80% of regional pollution. In the Middle East, North Africa and West sub-Saharan Africa, fine PM comes from natural sources, such as dust storms. Including older children, polluted air resulted in the death of over 700,000 children in 2021 ."
Air pollution,Ground-level ozone is one example of a secondary pollutant. Some pollutants may be both primary and secondary: they are both emitted directly and formed from other primary pollutants.
Inflation,"Stabilization policy must therefore try to steer economic activity so that the actual unemployment rate converges towards that level. The trade-off between the unemployment rate and inflation implied by Phillips thus holds in the short term, but not in the long term. Also the oil crises of the 1970s causing at the same time rising unemployment and rising inflation (i.e."
Air pollution,"Some can cause cancer, such as butadiene and benzene, with benzene being released from cigarette smoking. Methane is a greenhouse gas and the second-largest driver of global warming. Other VOCs contribute to climate warming because they help form ground-level ozone, a greenhouse gas."
Inflation,"However, economists generally advise against the imposition of price controls. Wage and price controls, in combination with rationing, have been used successfully in wartime environments. However, their use in other contexts is far more mixed."
Inflation,"Today, most economists favour a low and steady rate of inflation. Low (as opposed to zero or negative) inflation reduces the probability of economic recessions by enabling the labor market to adjust more quickly in a downturn and reduces the risk that a liquidity trap prevents monetary policy from stabilizing the economy while avoiding the costs associated with high inflation. The task of keeping the rate of inflation low and stable is usually given to central banks that control monetary policy, normally through the setting of interest rates and by carrying out open market operations."
Inflation,"Critics argue that this will cause arbitrary fluctuations in the inflation rate, and that monetary policy would essentially be determined by an intersection of however much new gold was produced by mining and changing demand for gold for practical uses. The gold standard was historically found to make it more difficult to stabilize employment levels and avoid recessions and was eventually abandoned everywhere."
Air pollution,"(PM), also known as particle pollution, includes all airborne substances that are not gases. It is a mix of microscopic solid particles or droplets suspended in a gas. It consists of a large variety of materials and chemical compounds including toxic substances, and they vary strongly in size."
Air pollution,"These indexes can indicate when air quality is good, when it is dangerous for sensitive groups (e.g. children with asthma) and when it is a general hazard."
Air pollution,"Most particulate matter is formed in the atmosphere from precursor gases. For instance, sulfate comes from SO2, nitrate from NO2, and ammonium is formed from ammonia. Soot on the other hand is directly emitted from combustion, and consists of black carbon and organic compounds."
Inflation,"For example, inflation and in particular food inflation is considered one of the main reasons that caused the 2010–2011 Tunisian revolution and the 2011 Egyptian revolution, according to many observers including Robert Zoellick, president of the World Bank. Tunisian president Zine El Abidine Ben Ali was ousted, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak was also ousted after only 18 days of demonstrations, and protests soon spread in many countries of North Africa and Middle East. Hyperinflation If inflation becomes too high, it can cause people to severely curtail their use of the currency, leading to an acceleration in the inflation rate."
Air pollution,"Coarse PM is 10 micrometer (μm) or smaller in diameter, fine PM is smaller than 2.5 μm, and ultrafine particles are 0.1 μm or smaller. Smaller particles pose more risk to health, as they can reach the bloodstream. A definitive link between fine particulate pollution and higher death rates in urban areas was established by the Harvard Six Cities study, published in 1993."
Inflation,"Annual escalation clauses in employment contracts can specify retroactive or future percentage increases in worker pay which are not tied to any index. These negotiated increases in pay are colloquially referred to as cost-of-living adjustments (""COLAs"") or cost-of-living increases because of their similarity to increases tied to externally determined indexes."
Inflation,"Sudden changes in consumer behavior can still introduce a weighting bias in inflation measurement. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic it has been shown that the basket of goods and services was no longer representative of consumption during the crisis, as numerous goods and services could no longer be consumed due to government containment measures (""lock-downs""). Over time, adjustments are also made to the type of goods and services selected to reflect changes in the sorts of goods and services purchased by 'typical consumers'."
Inflation,"When looking at inflation, economic institutions may focus only on certain kinds of prices, or special indices, such as the core inflation index which is used by central banks to formulate monetary policy. Most inflation indices are calculated from weighted averages of selected price changes. This necessarily introduces distortion, and can lead to legitimate disputes about what the true inflation rate is."
Inflation,"This problem can be overcome by including all available price changes in the calculation, and then choosing the median value. In some other cases, governments may intentionally report false inflation rates; for instance, during the presidency of Cristina Kirchner the government of Argentina was criticised for manipulating economic data, such as inflation and GDP figures, for political gain and to reduce payments on its inflation-indexed debt."
Air pollution,"Air pollution is the presence of substances in the air that are harmful to humans, other living beings or the environment. Pollutants can be gases, like ozone or nitrogen oxides, or small particles like soot and dust. Both outdoor and indoor air can be polluted."
Inflation,"This theory begins with the equation of exchange: M V , where M is the nominal quantity of money; V is the velocity of money in final expenditures; P is the general price level; Q is an index of the real value of final expenditures. In this formula, the general price level is related to the level of real economic activity (Q), the quantity of money (M) and the velocity of money (V). The formula itself is simply an uncontroversial accounting identity because the velocity of money (V) is defined residually from the equation to be the ratio of final nominal expenditure ( P Q ) to the quantity of money (M)."
Inflation,"During the Bullionist Controversy during the Napoleonic Wars, David Ricardo argued that the Bank of England had engaged in over-issue of bank notes, leading to commodity price increases. In the late 19th century, supporters of the quantity theory of money led by Irving Fisher debated with supporters of bimetallism. Later, Knut Wicksell sought to explain price movements as the result of real shocks rather than movements in money supply, resounding statements from the real bills doctrine."
Air pollution,"(VOC) are a class of carbon-based chemicals that exist as gases at room temperature, found both indoors and outdoors. They can cause photochemical smog and form aerosols impacting climate. The group includes methane, acetone and toluene."
Air pollution,"While many countries have air pollution laws, they differ in how they can be enforced via litigation. In the European Union, individual countries, including France, have been fined by the EU for not complying with air quality rules. The revised Ambient Air Quality Directive also makes it possible for individuals in the EU to seek compensation."
Air pollution,"The new limit for nitrogen dioxide became 75% lower. For all pollutants together, the WHO concluded that 99% of the world population is exposed to harmful air pollution. For some pollutants such as black carbon, traffic related exposures may dominate total exposure despite short exposure times, since high concentrations coincide with proximity to major roads or participation in (motorized) traffic."
Inflation,"During the 1980s and 1990s, there were often heated intellectual debates between new Keynesians and new classicals, but by the 2000s, a synthesis gradually emerged. The result has been called the new Keynesian model, the ""new neoclassical synthesis"" or simply the ""new consensus"" model."
Air pollution,"Outdoor air pollution comes from burning fossil fuels for electricity and transport, wildfires, some industrial processes, waste management, demolition and agriculture. Indoor air pollution is often from burning firewood or agricultural waste for cooking and heating. Other sources of air pollution include dust storms and volcanic eruptions."
Air pollution,"Sea spray, wildfires, volcanoes and dust storms are the main natural sources of PM. Meanwhile, human sources include the burning of biomass and fossil fuels, as well as road emissions and dust resuspension. Human PM is usually finer than natural PM."
Air pollution,"Other sources of indoor air pollution are building materials, biological material and tobacco smoke. Biological material, such as dander, house dust mite, mold and pollen, can come from humans, animals or plants. Some of this material can trigger allergies, such as allergic rhinitis."
Inflation,"–1700 caused several thinkers to present what is now considered to be early formulations of the quantity theory of money (QTM). Other contemporary authors attributed rising price levels to the debasement of national coinages. Later research has shown that also growing output of Central European silver mines and an increase in the velocity of money because of innovations in the payment technology, in particular the increased use of bills of exchange, contributed to the price revolution."
Air pollution,"Motor traffic can be reduced by creating more walkable cities and by investing in cycling infrastructure. Working from home is another way of avoiding motorised traffic. Traffic can be shifted to cleaner modes of transport by increasing use of public transport, for instance through higher parking fees or offering free public transport."
Air pollution,"Children in low- or middle-income countries are exposed to higher levels of fine particulate matter than those in high income countries. Further health effects of air pollution on children include asthma, pneumonia and lower respiratory tract infections. There is possibly a link between exposure to air pollution during pregnancy and after birth and autism in children."
Inflation,"From 2005 to 2019, it was found that the wellbeing costs of unemployment was 5 times higher than inflation. The trust between the central banks and individuals has become more limited. According to the Global Labor Organization (GLO), a global sample of 1.5 million observations during the 1999 and 2012 found a negative relationship of ECB unemployment between countries of Spain, Ireland, Greece, and Portugal a financial crisis."
Inflation,"They are more or less built into nominal interest rates, so that a rise (or fall) in the expected inflation rate will typically result in a rise (or fall) in nominal interest rates, giving a smaller effect if any on real interest rates. In addition, higher expected inflation tends to be built into the rate of wage increases, giving a smaller effect if any on the changes in real wages. Moreover, the response of inflationary expectations to monetary policy can influence the division of the effects of policy between inflation and unemployment (see monetary policy credibility)."
Inflation,"While comparing inflation measures for various periods one has to take into consideration the base effect as well. Inflation measures are often modified over time, either for the relative weight of goods in the basket, or in the way in which goods and services from the present are compared with goods and services from the past. Basket weights are updated regularly, usually every year, to adapt to changes in consumer behavior."
Inflation,"This level may itself change over time when institutional or natural constraints change. It corresponds to the Non-Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment, NAIRU, or the ""natural"" rate of unemployment (sometimes called the ""structural"" level of unemployment). If GDP exceeds its potential (and unemployment consequently is below the NAIRU), the theory says that inflation will accelerate as suppliers increase their prices."
Air pollution,"It is a significant risk factor for a number of diseases, including stroke, heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma and lung cancer. Particulate matter is the most deadly, both for indoor and outdoor air pollution. Ozone affects crops, and forests are damaged by the pollution that causes acid rain."
Inflation,"There can also be negative effects to trade from an increased instability in currency exchange prices caused by unpredictable inflation. Hoarding People buy durable and/or non-perishable commodities and other goods as stores of wealth, to avoid the losses expected from the declining purchasing power of money, creating shortages of the hoarded goods. Social unrest and revolts Inflation can lead to massive demonstrations and revolutions."
Inflation,"Inflation numbers are often seasonally adjusted to differentiate expected cyclical cost shifts. For example, home heating costs are expected to rise in colder months, and seasonal adjustments are often used when measuring inflation to compensate for cyclical energy or fuel demand spikes. Inflation numbers may be averaged or otherwise subjected to statistical techniques to remove statistical noise and volatility of individual prices."
Air pollution,"Roughly 68% of outdoor air pollution-related premature deaths were due to coronary heart disease and stroke, 14% due to COPD and 14% due to lung infections (lower respiratory tract infections). A study published in 2019 estimated that, for 2015, the number was around 8.8 million, with 5.5 million of these premature deaths due to air pollution from human sources. The global mean loss of life expectancy from air pollution in 2015 was 2.9 years, substantially more than, for example, 0.3 years from all forms of direct violence."
Air pollution,"National air quality laws have often been effective, notably the 1956 Clean Air Act in Britain and the 1963 US Clean Air Act. International efforts have had mixed results: the Montreal Protocol almost eliminated harmful ozone-depleting chemicals, while international action on climate change has been less successful."
Inflation,"stagflation) led to a broad recognition by economists that supply shocks could independently affect inflation. During the 1980s a group of researchers named new Keynesians emerged who accepted many originally non-Keynesian concepts like the importance of monetary policy, the existence of a natural level of unemployment and the incorporation of rational expectations formation as a reasonable benchmark. At the same time they believed, like Keynes did, that various market imperfections in different markets like labour markets and financial markets were also important to study to understand both inflation generation and business cycles."
Inflation,"In 1990, New Zealand as the first country ever adopted an official inflation target as the basis of its monetary policy, continually adjusting interest rates to steer the country's inflation rate towards its official target. The strategy was generally considered to work well, and central banks in most developed countries have over the years adapted a similar strategy. As of 2023, the central banks of all G7 member countries can be said to follow an inflation target, including the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve, who have adopted the main elements of inflation targeting without officially calling themselves inflation targeters."
Inflation,"The system disintegrated in the 1970s, however, after which the major currencies started floating against each other. During the 1970s many central banks turned to a money supply target recommended by Milton Friedman and other monetarists, aiming for a stable growth rate of money to control inflation. However, it was found to be impractical because of the unstable relationship between monetary aggregates and other macroeconomic variables, and was eventually abandoned by all major economies."
Inflation,"In 2019, monetary historians Thomas M. Humphrey and Richard Timberlake published ""Gold, the Real Bills Doctrine, and the Fed: Sources of Monetary Disorder 1922–1938""."
Air pollution,"Examples include carbon monoxide gas from car exhausts, and sulfur dioxide from factories. Secondary pollutants are not emitted directly. Rather, they form in the air when primary pollutants react with each other or with other parts of the atmosphere."
Air pollution,"The density of measurements is improving as there are more low-cost techniques to measure air pollution. Low-cost monitors can also be used for indoor air quality monitoring. Finally, air quality sensors can be incorporated into drones to measure air pollution higher up in the air."
Inflation,"He, together with Edmund Phelps, contended that the trade-off between inflation and unemployment implied by the Phillips curve was only temporary, but not permanent. If politicians tried to exploit it, it would eventually disappear because higher inflation would over time be built into the economic expectations of households and firms. This line of thinking led to the concept of potential output (sometimes called the ""natural gross domestic product""), a level of GDP where the economy is stable in the sense that inflation will neither decrease nor increase."
Inflation,"The double-digit inflation era was of short duration, however, inflation by the mid-1980s returned to more modest levels. Amid this, general trends there have been spectacular high-inflation episodes in individual countries in interwar Europe, towards the end of the Nationalist Chinese government in 1948–1949, and later in some Latin American countries, in Israel, and in Zimbabwe. Some of these episodes are considered hyperinflation periods, normally designating inflation rates that surpass 50 percent monthly."
Inflation,"High and accelerating inflation grossly interferes with the normal workings of the economy, hurting its ability to supply goods. Hyperinflation can lead people to abandon the use of the country's currency in favour of external currencies (dollarization), as has been reported to have occurred in North Korea. Corruption Due to a high rise of inflation, it has been seen to affect unemployment levels around the world."
Air pollution,"For adults, fine particles or NO2 seem linked to asthma onset too. Short-term exposure to ozone makes asthma worse in children. There is limited evidence on (almost) fatal asthma attacks in children: ground-level ozone and PM2.5 seem to increase its risk."
Air pollution,"For some pollutants, low exposure can be seen as safe, whereas other pollutants have negative health effects even at low levels. As evidence has grown that even very low levels of air pollutants hurt human health, the WHO halved its recommended safe limit for particulate matter from 10 μg/m3 to 5 μg/m3 in 2021. Under the new guideline, nearly the entire global population—97%—is classified as exposed to unsafe levels of PM2.5."
Air pollution,"This question of terminology has practical consequences, for example, in determining whether the U.S. Clean Air Act (which is designed to improve air quality) is deemed to regulate CO2 emissions. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 amended the Clean Air Act to define CO2 from fossil fuel burning explicitly as an air pollutant."
Inflation,"Should the bank fail to get or maintain assets of adequate value, then the bank's money will lose value, just as any financial security will lose value if its asset backing diminishes. The real bills doctrine (also known as the backing theory) thus asserts that inflation results when money outruns its issuer's assets. The quantity theory of money, in contrast, claims that inflation results when money outruns the economy's production of goods."
Inflation,"Notable failures of their use include the 1972 imposition of wage and price controls by Richard Nixon. More successful examples include the Prices and Incomes Accord in Australia and the Wassenaar Agreement in the Netherlands. In general, wage and price controls are regarded as a temporary and exceptional measures, only effective when coupled with policies designed to reduce the underlying causes of inflation during the wage and price control regime, for example, winning the war being fought."
Inflation,"Lack of trust is shown between the government and political institutions which potentially, this can create bias towards both sides as unemployment rate will still increase. If the rate goes on, predictions of the economic activity may decrease, and investments from around the world will soon slowdown creating an ""economy crash"" that can affect millions of peoples' living. Allocative efficiency A change in the supply or demand for a good will normally cause its relative price to change, signaling the buyers and sellers that they should re-allocate resources in response to the new market conditions."
Air pollution,"The COVID-19 lockdowns created a natural experiment to examine the links between air quality and agricultural output. In India, the lockdown improved air quality, which enhanced surface greenness and photosynthetic activity. Both forests and crops saw positive effects; the improvement was most pronounced for crops."
Air pollution,"Fine particles and NO2 are associated with increased risk of developing COPD. In children, air pollution can hinder lung development, which may increase their susceptibility to COPD later in life. Air pollution is further associated with increased risk of asthma and worsening of symptoms, and this effect seems stronger in children."
Inflation,"The hyperinflation in Venezuela is the highest in the world, with an annual inflation rate of 833,997% as of October 2018. Historically, inflations of varying magnitudes have occurred, interspersed with corresponding deflationary periods, from the price revolution of the 16th century, which was driven by the flood of gold and particularly silver seized and mined by the Spaniards in Latin America, to the largest paper money inflation of all time in Hungary after World War II. However, since the 1980s, inflation has been held low and stable in countries with independent central banks."
Air pollution,"Overall, the World Bank has estimated that welfare losses (premature deaths) and productivity losses (lost labour) caused by air pollution cost the world economy over $8 trillion per year. Various technologies and strategies reduce air pollution. Key approaches include clean cookers, fire protection, improved waste management, dust control, industrial scrubbers, electric vehicles and renewable energy."
Air pollution,"Tackling congestion, which increases fuel usage, with congestion charging, also shifts people to use cleaner modes of transport. Finally, road vehicles can be improved from increased fuel efficiency, improved quality of fuels, emission standards, and conversion to electric vehicles. For example, buses in New Delhi, India, switched to compressed natural gas after 2000, to reduce the city's thick pea soup smog."
Air pollution,Some websites attempt to map air pollution levels using available data. Air quality indexes (AQIs) offer a simple way to communicate changes in air quality and associated health risks to a wide audience. An AQI is essentially a health protection tool people can use to help reduce their short-term exposure to air pollution by adjusting activity levels during increased levels of air pollution.
Inflation,"New products may be introduced, older products disappear, the quality of existing products may change, and consumer preferences can shift. Different segments of the population may naturally consume different ""baskets"" of goods and services and may even experience different inflation rates. It is argued that companies have put more innovation into bringing down prices for wealthy families than for poor families."
Air pollution,"These clean cooking devices, including those run on fossil fuels, usually have a smaller climate impact than traditional biomass stoves. Kerosine for lighting can be replaced with efficient LED lights, for instance, solar-powered LED lights. Combustion of fossil fuels for space heating can be replaced by the use of electricity in heat pumps."
Air pollution,(WHO) estimates that cooking-related pollution causes 3.8 million annual deaths. The Global Burden of Disease study estimated the number of deaths in 2021 at 3.1 million.
Inflation,Salaries are typically adjusted annually in low inflation economies. During hyperinflation they are adjusted more often. They may also be tied to a cost-of-living index that varies by geographic location if the employee moves.
Air pollution,"Similarly, heating systems such as furnaces and other types of fuel-burning heating devices release pollutants into the air. In some developed countries, including the UK and Sydney, Australia, wood stoves are the major source of particulate pollution in urban areas. Wood stoves can also emit carbon monoxide and NOx."
Inflation,"Monetarists assumed additionally that the velocity of money is unaffected by monetary policy (at least in the long run), that the real value of output is also exogenous in the long run, its long-run value being determined independently by the productive capacity of the economy, and that money supply is exogenous and can be controlled by the monetary authorities. Under these assumptions, the primary driver of the change in the general price level is changes in the quantity of money. Consequently, monetarists contended that monetary policy, not fiscal policy, was the most potent instrument to influence aggregate demand, real output and eventually inflation."
Air pollution,"While China allows litigation on environmental grounds, it is rare as it is seen as risky. In Chile, the right to a healthy environment is part of the constitution, and the Supreme Court found that the government has to act to provide clear air because of this."
Inflation,"A third group, the Free Banking School, held that competitive private banks would not overissue, even though a monopolist central bank could be believed to do it. The debate between currency, or quantity theory, and banking schools during the 19th century prefigures current questions about the credibility of money in the present. In the 19th century, the banking schools had greater influence in policy in the United States and Great Britain, while the currency schools had more influence ""on the continent"", that is in non-British countries, particularly in the Latin Monetary Union and the Scandinavian Monetary Union."
Air pollution,"It is the main gas in photochemical smog. It can be harmful to human health, but also to some materials, forests, plants and crops. Smog is a particular problem in big cities where it cannot easily be transported away by wind, for instance cities built in valleys surrounded by mountains."
Air pollution,"Over a third of preterm births were associated with air pollution in 2021 globally. It causes more than half a million newborn deaths, a quarter of overall deaths. The source of PM2.5 differs greatly by region."
