Air pollution,"Other elements, such as aluminium, which were toxic to vegetation, became available for the roots to absorb. Acid rain also impacts buildings and statues made of specific stones (e.g. marble, calcite or freestone), as the stone reacts chemically with the acid in the water and erodes."
Inflation,"However, since cash is still needed to carry out transactions this means that more ""trips to the bank"" are necessary to make withdrawals, proverbially wearing out the ""shoe leather"" with each trip. Menu cost With high inflation, firms must change their prices often to keep up with economy-wide changes. But often changing prices is itself a costly activity whether explicitly, as with the need to print new menus, or implicitly, as with the extra time and effort needed to change prices constantly."
Inflation,"A weighted price is calculated by multiplying the unit price of an item by the number of that item the average consumer purchases. Weighted pricing is necessary to measure the effect of individual unit price changes on the economy's overall inflation. The consumer price index, for example, uses data collected by surveying households to determine what proportion of the typical consumer's overall spending is spent on specific goods and services, and weights the average prices of those items accordingly."
Air pollution,"Urbanization leads to a rapid rise in premature mortality due to air pollution in fast-growing tropical cities. Indoor air pollution on the other hand is most common in rural areas, which may lack access to clean cooking fuels. A map published in 2025 by Climate TRACE indicates that PM2.5 (fine particles) and other toxins are released near the homes of about 1.6 billion people, about 900 million of whom are in the path of ""super-emitting"" facilities such as power plants, refineries, ports and mines."
Inflation,"A U.S. silver certificate, for example, could be redeemed for an actual piece of silver. Under a gold standard, the long term rate of inflation (or deflation) would be determined by the growth rate of the supply of gold relative to total output."
Air pollution,"The theory motivated an enormous emphasis on public sanitation in major cities to remove smelly pollution, especially human and animal excrement, from streets and back alleys. The theory collapsed when physicians accepted the new germ theory of disease in the late 19th century. Germs coughed up by an infected person or spread by certain types of mosquitos or hookworms were the real reason people caught an infectious disease."
Air pollution,"is mainly emitted by the burning of fossil fuels. CO2 is sometimes called an air pollutant, because it is the main greenhouse gas responsible for climate change. Although the World Health Organization recognizes CO2 as a climate pollutant, it does not include the gas in its Air Quality Guidelines or set recommended targets for it."
Air pollution,"The term acid rain not only refers to rain, but also to pollution from hail, fog and snow. Acid rain caused substantial damage in the 1970, including lake acidification and forest diebacks in Northern Europe. Due to the changed acidity in water bodies and soils, essential nutrients such as magnesium and calcium became soluble and could be washed away."
Inflation,"During the 19th century, three different schools debated these questions: The British Currency School upheld a quantity theory view, believing that the Bank of England's issues of bank notes should vary one-for-one with the bank's gold reserves. In contrast to this, the British Banking School followed the real bills doctrine, recommending that the bank's operations should be governed by the needs of trade: Banks should be able to issue currency against bills of trading, i.e. ""real bills"" that they buy from merchants."
Inflation,"But when prices are constantly changing due to inflation, price changes due to genuine relative price signals are difficult to distinguish from price changes due to general inflation, so agents are slow to respond to them. The result is a loss of allocative efficiency. Shoe leather cost High inflation increases the opportunity cost of holding cash balances and can induce people to hold a greater portion of their assets in interest paying accounts."
